                            <p> Getting a job can be a difficult task, and it can be incredibly challenging for minorities, particularly Black people. Despite the various measures that have been taken
                                to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, many Black people still face barriers when it comes to finding employment. One of the most significant factors
                                contributing to this disparity is networking, which is often described as "who you know" rather than "what you know." This means that a person's chances of finding
                                employment are significantly influenced by their network and connections. </p>
                            <p> It is no secret that networking is an essential part of finding employment. The power of networking is undeniable, as it can help job seekers find potential employers
                                and increase their chances of getting hired. However, research has shown that the type of network a person has can affect their job search outcome. For example, a
                                Harvard Business Review study found that people with an extensive network of contacts are more likely to find a job faster than those with a limited network. However,
                                the study also found that people who rely on their close network, which comprises family and friends, are less likely to find a job compared to those with a more
                                diverse network. </p>
                            <p> This brings us to the issue: why do most of my white friends get their jobs through their friends while my Black friends have to go through multiple interviews to
                                secure a job? The answer lies in the type of network each group has. In general, white people tend to have a more extensive network of contacts, including people
                                already in positions of power and influence. This means that when a job opportunity arises, a white person is more likely to hear about it through their network and
                                secure the position without going through the rigorous interview process. </p>
                            <p> On the other hand, Black people tend to have a more limited network of contacts, which makes it more challenging to find employment. The lack of diversity in their
                                network means they do not have access to the same job opportunities as their white counterparts. Additionally, Black people often face unconscious bias during the
                                hiring process, which can further hinder their chances of securing a job. </p>
                            <p> To illustrate this point, let us consider a hypothetical scenario. Suppose a white person and a Black person are both looking for employment. The white person has a
                                friend who works at a company with an open position. The friend informs the white person about the job opening, and they apply. Since an employee of the company
                                referred them, the white person's chances of getting hired are higher. In contrast, the Black person may not have anyone in their network who works at the same company.
                                Therefore, they must undergo the normal hiring process, which may involve several interviews, assessments, and reference checks. Even if Black people are more qualified
                                than white people, they may not get the job due to unconscious bias during the hiring process. </p>
                            <p> It is crucial to note that this issue is not solely limited to Black people. People from other minority groups, such as Hispanics and Indigenous people, face similar
                                challenges when finding employment. The lack of diversity in their network means they do not have access to the same job opportunities as their white counterparts,
                                which puts them at a disadvantage during the job search process. </p>
                            <p> Networking is a crucial aspect of finding employment, and the type of network a person has can significantly impact their chances of getting hired. White people tend to
                                have a more extensive network of contacts, which gives them access to a broader range of job opportunities. In contrast, Black people often have a more limited network
                                of contacts, which makes it more challenging to find employment. Additionally, unconscious bias during the hiring process can further hinder the chances of Black people
                                securing a job. </p>
