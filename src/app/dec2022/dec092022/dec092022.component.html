                            <p> As a cloud user, you have likely realized that cloud services have changed how we do things. With elasticity, pay-as-you-go pricing, and rapid innovation, it can take a
                                lot of work to keep up with all the cloud changes. I'm sharing some tips on getting started to ensure you're using your services correctly and saving money. </p>
                            <p> The rate of change in the cloud is so fast that it is easy to get outdated in your knowledge. </p>
                            <p> The cloud is not a static environment—it is constantly changing, and you need to keep up with it. The cloud is constantly evolving, and the pace of change can be
                                dizzying. Knowing this, you should strive to stay caught up in your knowledge. </p>
                            <p> With the cloud, you are paying for what you use and not paying for more. </p>
                            <p> Chances are you need to be using your cloud services correctly and overpaying as a result. With the cloud, you are paying for what you use and not paying for more. Not
                                only can this save money, but it also means that it's quick and easy when you need to scale up or down. </p>
                            <p> Cloud pricing is based on a combination of three factors: compute, storage and transfer. </p>
                            <p> Compute refers to the amount of processing power you use. Storage is the amount of space you use on your cloud <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3a64388bbe76b2957e6be89844c315e6&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=11036071">server</a>. Transfer refers to the amount of data you send to
                                and from your cloud <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3a64388bbe76b2957e6be89844c315e6&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=11036071">server</a>. </p>
                            <p> This means that if you're using more storage than usual, then it's likely that your bill will rise accordingly—and vice versa if there's less than usually used in
                                either transactional or non-transactional capacity. </p>
                            <p> Many users need clarification about monitoring and backup costs in the cloud. </p>
                            <p> You'll want a backup. </p>
                            <p> Many users need clarification about monitoring and backup costs in the cloud. They think that because they're paying for a certain amount of storage, they won't incur
                                additional charges for using it. But this is only sometimes true. It's not even close to being true most of the time—the price per GB is usually much lower than the
                                price per TB when you buy your storage on its own ($0.05-$0.06 per GB vs. $1-$3 per TB). Therefore, if you're planning on storing 1TB of data on Amazon S3 or Azure Blob
                                Storage, backing up all of those files will cost about $6-12 extra every month (depending on how many files are included in your backup). </p>
                            <p> Understanding the relationships between regions, availability zones, and edge caching will help you know how to optimize costs. </p>
                            <p> You can think of each region as a city, like New York or Tokyo. Availability zones are like neighborhoods within those cities; they're all part of the same metropolitan
                                area but still distinct. </p>
                            <p> Let's say you want to optimize performance for your users in Japan. You could set up an edge cache in Tokyo and send them custom content instead of letting them
                                download it from California or Ireland, where your main data centers are located. In this way, you can get better results without investing heavily in infrastructure
                                costs or waiting for things like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=478548468582b9fce471d3481015a0bc&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=172504">network</a> latency between regions and availability zones (which might be slow). </p>
                            <p> Pricing models can be confusing once you know what you are being charged for. </p>
                            <p> Regarding your monthly bill, it's essential to understand what you are being charged for and how much each line item costs. Pricing models can be confusing, especially
                                when working with several cloud services. Pricing models often combine multiple services into one line item but only charge you for one service. In an example of a
                                pricing model, Google charges $2 per user per month for G Suite (which includes Gmail), while Amazon charges $10 per user per month for S3 (the storage part of AWS).
                            </p>
                            <p> An excellent way to compare different cloud providers is by looking at their cost per gigabyte (GB) used across all of their offerings. By making this comparison, a
                                customer can quickly see which provider offers the lowest price per GB across all services provided. </p>
                            <p> Additional benefits offered by cloud vendors can often provide savings over traditional on-premises solutions. These advantages include services such as: </p>
                            <p> Monitoring and alerting—Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers offer various additional services, including monitoring and alerting tools that help you quickly scan
                                your infrastructure, identify problems, and resolve them before they impact business operations. This service is beneficial for optimizing costs because it allows you
                                to scale down processes when fewer resources are available (like during times of lower demand). Still, it also helps ensure that critical applications remain up at all
                                times. Not only does this feature help reduce costs by preventing downtime due to resource availability issues, but it also allows businesses to minimize their need for
                                expensive staff members who may be required if they use an in-house solution instead. </p>
                            <p> Take the time to learn how your cloud vendor charges for services. </p>
                            <p> It's essential to take the time to learn how your cloud vendor charges for services. For example, if you're using an AWS instance in Amazon's US-East region with a
                                price of $0.10 per hour, that would cost $1 a month. But if you were to run the same instance in AWS' Ireland region at €0.42 per hour—which is about $0.49 per
                                hour—your monthly bill would be closer to $3 per month. </p>
                            <p> Understanding how pricing models work and what factors affect them can help you save money on cloud services by helping you make smarter decisions when purchasing them
                                or evaluating new options as they become available (for example, if one vendor offers free transfers). </p>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> There is no doubt that the cloud has changed the way we use technology. And with the constant evolution of this new world, many things about it remain a mystery. But by
                                learning how your cloud vendor charges for services, you can save yourself money and get more out of your cloud service than you ever thought possible! </p>
