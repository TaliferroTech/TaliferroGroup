                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> Cloud architecture is something that's becoming more and more important. Companies are moving to the cloud because it enables faster growth, but ensuring your company
                                is using the best cloud provider for their needs can take time and effort. That's why I love Google Cloud Platform so much: it's simple, robust, and easy to start
                                with—and there are many different things you can do. From 2010 - 2015 I was heavy into AWS architecture. From 2015 - 2018 Azure Architecture. But in 2018 and 2020 when
                                I actually had to implement my own cloud architecture, the heavens opened when I tried GCP. </p>
                            <p> It's just so easy in comparison to othe providers. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> For your architecture </h2>
                            <p> GCP is the cheapest, easiest and fastest way to start with a scalable and reliable architecture. At a glance, here are some of the reasons why GCP is your best choice:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> It was cheap! You can save up to 30% compared to other providers by using GCP for your projects. </li>
                                <li> It's easy! You don't need any complex infrastructure or dependencies like VMs or containers running - use their services directly in the browser with no
                                    installation required. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> straightforward </h2>
                            <p> The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has a simple architecture that makes it easy to start and create complex architectures. With GCP, you can start with one or two services
                                and add more as your needs grow. </p>
                            <p> One of the great things about Google Cloud Platform is that it allows you to quickly build and manage your infrastructure from the cloud using just a few clicks of the
                                mouse or taps on the keyboard. You don't need to learn any new languages or technologies when working with GCP; you can to use their built-in features and tools to
                                create an environment for running applications in minutes. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Easy to get started </h2>
                            <p> If you are a developer, you can create a project in less than a minute. Creating VMs and containers is very simple in the console. You can launch an instance with a
                                persistent disk and run kubectl commands from there. </p>
                            <p> If you need help getting started, the GKE onboarding wizard will walk you through everything. </p>
                            <p> Google has a wide range of services that you can use to create highly complex architectures. These include: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> BigQuery — You can access data stored in BigQuery, which contains 100 terabytes of data for free and provides powerful querying capabilities. </li>
                                <li> Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) — A managed platform that makes it easy to run applications on the same cluster across a fleet of containers using Kubernetes. GKE
                                    also has built-in monitoring and diagnostics tools so that you can identify problems quickly. </li>
                                <li> Cloud Storage — In addition to deploying containers with GKE, you can store your images in Cloud Storage buckets, which will work seamlessly with other Google
                                    services such as App Engine Flexible Environment or Firebase Hosting. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> BigQuery </h2>
                            <p> BigQuery is a cloud-based analytics data warehouse built for petabyte-scale datasets. It is the only fully managed, enterprise-grade cloud data warehouse with
                                pay-as-you-go pricing. BigQuery enables you to run ad hoc queries against your data using SQL and to analyze it using rich visualization tools and dashboards. You can
                                also use BigQuery as a storage layer for other Google Cloud Platform services or third-party applications that need to process large amounts of data in near real-time
                                (which BigQuery does at scale). </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Google Kubernetes Engine </h2>
                            <p> Kubernetes Engine is a managed Kubernetes environment that handles the complexity of running Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). If you're familiar with AWS or
                                Azure, this is the equivalent of having a cluster manager for your containers. </p>
                            <p> So how does it work? When you deploy an application to GKE, it automatically spins up at least one instance of each component needed for your application. This includes
                                its supportive services, such as load balancers and persistent storage volume managers. You can also choose from multiple options for how much capacity you want to be
                                allocated to each component in advance—something called "preemptible" instances—which means GKE may terminate them if they aren't being used. This allows us to save
                                money while ensuring we have enough capacity available when we need it. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Cloud Storage </h2>
                            <p> My favorite aspects of GCP. This service stores your data in the cloud and makes it accessible from anywhere. There are two types of storage: object storage and file
                                storage. Object storage works like a database table where you can store any information as rows (or "objects"). File Storage organizes files into folders, just like
                                when you manage the files on your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=cb303e3e6bde4143072cb5efaabcc9b3&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=565098">computer</a> or mobile device. Both services allow storing text documents, videos, images, and more. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> fast </h2>
                            <p> Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud services you can use to create websites and applications. It has a wide range of services, including App Engine,
                                Dataflow, BigQuery, Spanner, and more. </p>
                            <p> GCP also provides robust distributed systems with Google Container Engine (GKE), Kubernetes Engine (K8S), Cloud DNS, and Load Balancing Services. These allow you to
                                build your computing infrastructure and deploy it into GCP. </p>
                            <p> Suppose you're looking to build a complex architecture with several layers or multiple tiers. In that case, GKE will be your best bet since it gives you complete
                                control over the underlying hardware layer but doesn't require any knowledge about container orchestrators like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. </p>
                            <p> GCP Cloud Architecture is also reasonably inexpensive. The cost of GCP services is much lower than other cloud providers, such as AWS or Microsoft Azure. This makes it
                                great for small businesses, as well as those who are on a budget. GCP Cloud Architecture has proven to be a handy tool that every business can benefit from in some way
                                or another. It will allow you to reach new heights in your business and take it to new levels you had never even thought possible. </p>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> There are many great things about Google Cloud Platform, and it's the best choice for your cloud architecture needs. It's easy to start, has a wide range of services
                                you can use to create complex architectures, and is relatively inexpensive. What more could we want? </p>
