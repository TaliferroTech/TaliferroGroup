                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> Technology plays a vital role in every business, and companies that can leverage technology have a competitive edge in the marketplace. This is why non-technical
                                executives should view their IT department not only as a business support unit but as a money-making unit of the company. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize">IT</h2>
                            <p> The IT department is also responsible for fixing computers or managing the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=478548468582b9fce471d3481015a0bc&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=172504">network</a>. They are responsible for creating and implementing technology strategies
                                to help the business grow and become more profitable. Non-technical executives need to understand this and treat their IT department accordingly. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize">Efficiency</h2>
                            <p> Improving efficiency is one of the most significant ways the IT department can help the business make more money. By automating processes, reducing manual labor, and
                                streamlining workflows, the IT department can help the company save time and money. For example, suppose the IT department develops a custom software solution for a
                                specific business process. In that case, it could significantly reduce the time it takes to complete that process, allowing the business to allocate resources
                                elsewhere. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Alternative Uses </h2>
                            <p> Another way that the IT department can help the business make more money is by developing new products or services. With technology rapidly advancing, there are always
                                new opportunities for innovation. The IT department can work with other departments to identify areas where technology can be used to create new revenue streams. For
                                example, an IT department might develop a mobile app that customers can use to purchase products or services. </p>
                            <p> The IT department can also help the business make more money by improving customer service. By implementing tools such as chatbots or customer relationship management
                                (CRM) software, the IT department can help the business better serve its customers. This, in turn, can lead to increased customer satisfaction, repeat business, and
                                positive reviews. </p>
                            <p> Non-technical executives should also recognize the value of data. The IT department is responsible for collecting and analyzing data from various sources, such as
                                sales, customer, and website analytics. By understanding this data, non-technical executives can make informed decisions to help the business grow. For example, suppose
                                the data shows that customers frequently abandon online shopping carts. In that case, the IT department can work with the marketing department to develop a strategy to
                                reduce cart abandonment. </p>
                            <p> Finally, the IT department can help the business make more money by improving cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is essential to protecting a company's assets in today's
                                digital age. If the IT department can prevent a cyber-attack, it can save the company millions of dollars in potential damages and loss of reputation. </p>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> Non-technical executives should view their IT department not only as a business support unit but as a money-making unit of the company. By understanding the potential
                                of technology and the role of the IT department in creating and implementing technology strategies, non-technical executives can make informed decisions that can help
                                the business grow and become more profitable. </p>
