<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    It has always surprised me how many clients ask for agile software development processes but never prepare to follow through on their commitment. I'm talking about clients who ask us to build a traditional waterfall project with an agile component tacked on at the end (because it will be cheaper) or something similar. While I can appreciate their desire to save money while still getting some of the benefits of agile development practices like user testing and sprint planning meetings with stakeholders, these requests can lead down a slippery slope if you don't make sure everyone involved understands what "agile" really means before you begin any project together. So here are some tips for navigating tricky conversations with your client about why agile isn't just another buzzword. These tips go for me, too, by the way.
</p>   
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    The client wants to use agile but in their way
</h2>
<p>
    If a client has a specific idea of what they want, but there are better solutions to their problem, then you need to find out why they are so keen on agile. If other solutions are available and you know how they work, share them with your clients so they can decide which process works best for them.
</p>
<p>
    If a client has yet to learn what he wants or how he wants it done, this is where your skills as an <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> coach come into play. You should be able to help them identify their goals and constraints so that together you can come up with solutions that meet both needs.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    It's essential first to understand what the client is talking about
</h2>
<p>
    Ask questions like "What do you mean by '<a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a>'?" or "What do you mean by 'process'?" and make sure you understand what they're saying. Don't assume that because a client says "agile" or "process," they ask for an agile process.
</p>
<p>
    For this conversation to go well, keep them from defining the terms of the discussion. For example: if someone says, "I want an <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> process," don't respond with something like, "Well, we use Scrum at Company X." Instead, ask questions until it becomes clear exactly what kind of process they want, and then explain why your company uses Scrum (or another method) over other types of methodologies such as Kanban.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure your client understands the principles of agile development.
</p>
<p>
    Agile is about collaboration, communication, and feedback.
</p>
<p>
    Agile is about working software over documentation.
</p>
<p>
    Agile is about responding to change by following a plan.
</p>
<p>
    Agile is about embracing change over following a plan.
</p>
<p>
    Agile processes are flexible, so there's no one way to do things.
</p>
<p>
    Agile processes are designed with change in mind. 
</p>
<p>
    They allow you to respond quickly and effectively when your client wants something different than initially planned without going back through all the steps. This is why you must understand how agile works before starting a project. You need to know what questions you can ask on behalf of your client without getting stuck in an endless loop or causing delays for everyone involved.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you're working with a company that wants an <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> process but wants to avoid following the framework precisely as written, talk through each step individually until you find one where everyone feels comfortable moving together.
</p>
<p>
    When your client wants an <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> approach but avoids following the framework, it's essential to ask questions and understand what they're asking. You'll need to help them understand the difference between agile and traditional approaches, explain why Agile is a good fit for their needs, and how it can help them achieve their goals.

</p>
<p>
    It's essential to take things slowly, starting with a thorough understanding of your client's wants and needs.
</p>
<p>
    The first thing you should do is make sure that you understand your client's wants and needs. They may have yet to think through exactly what they need, so it's essential to take things step by step, starting with a thorough understanding of their goals.
</p>
<p>
    If they've had experience with <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> processes, ask them about their experiences and any problems they encountered. Ask them if there are specific things they like or dislike about other companies' agile practices; this will help you get an idea of what principles would work best for the project.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        They don't have the budget for frequent user tests or prototypes
    </li>
    <li>
        User testing is critical

    </li>
    <li>
        Prototypes can be cheap or expensive, depending on how much time you want to put into them and what kind of prototype you're building
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Mockups are easier than wireframes
</h2>
<p>
    Mockups don't require as much effort, but they won't show the client exactly what you mean. They're good for getting feedback on ideas before going into wireframes or prototypes.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    They want to be able to change their mind without consulting anyone
</h2>
<p>
    This can be tricky, as it's not uncommon for clients to express an interest in <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> when they mean, "I want the flexibility of being able to change my mind." This is especially true if you're working on a small project with limited resources and time constraints. If your client wants something different than what was planned at the beginning of development (and they will), then there needs to be some process in place, so everyone knows where they stand on the issue at hand.
</p>
<p>
    Clients who are open about their desire for flexibility will often tell you why: maybe they had an idea while talking through requirements that could save money or improve performance; perhaps there's been some unexpected change in circumstance since starting work; maybe someone came up with something new during testing and thought it might work better than what was originally planned out. These kinds of requests should never come as a surprise if everyone has had ample opportunity throughout development cycles, such as sprint planning meetings where these things could've been discussed before making significant changes like adding new features later down the line after testing has already taken place.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    They don't want to have a product backlog
</h2>
<p>
    A product backlog is a must-have in any <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> project. It's where you can store all your feature requests and tasks so everyone on the team knows what they need to work on next.
    A good product backlog has three key characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It's prioritized. Your client wants something done quickly, and they want it done right, so prioritizing features is essential to creating a good product backlog. It would help if you started by estimating how long each item will take (in days or weeks), then rank them based on those estimates. The highest-ranking things are going to get worked on first.
    </li>
    <li>
        It includes everything needed before launching into production mode; anything else should be included later when more resources are available for development work. The contents of this list frequently change as new ideas emerge during discussions about what features should be included in future releases. If there's yet to be a budget for building this feature, put it back at the bottom until there is enough money.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Their stakeholders disagree on what success looks like
</h2>
<p>
    Agile is a process, not a project. It's important to remember this when you're working with clients who want the benefits of <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> without following its framework. The most common mistake people make is taking an "agile" approach without actually being agile; they use terms like "sprints," "stand-ups," and "iterations" but don't follow any of these practices.
</p>
<p>
    It's also possible for someone to be more rigidly adherent to their prescribed methodology, which is why we need more than one method. Agile methods are designed as starting points for organizations looking to improve processes; they provide frameworks that can be adapted and customized according to each organization's needs and culture.
</p>
<p>
    Don't lie to your client. Instead, get real with them, and they will likely help find a solution.
</p>
<p>
    Don't use the "we follow the <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> framework" line to avoid having an honest conversation about how they want to work with you. Instead, get real with them and tell them what's going on:
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    You don't want to waste time building a process that won't work 
</h2>
<p>
    You're worried about wasting money on something that will not add value

</p>
<p>
    The good news is that this type of honesty will likely lead your client to seek help finding solutions instead of trying to convince themselves there isn't one.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    If you're in this situation, it's important to remember that you can't force your client to do anything. If they want an <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> process but want to avoid following the agile framework, then that's their choice. However, you can help them find a solution by listening carefully and understanding.
