                        <p> If you've been working with software for the past few years, you've heard about microservices architecture. It's a popular approach to building applications that can help
                            engineers and product teams decompose monolithic codebases into smaller, more manageable chunks. In this guide, we'll explain what microservices architecture is, why it
                            matters, and some key benefits and challenges of using it. By the end of this article, you'll know whether your team should consider moving toward microservices. </p>

                        <p> Fermi estimation is a simple yet potent tool you can use for your business and the development of your software projects. The purpose of Fermi estimation is to estimate
                            things without breaking a sweat. How does it work? We take advantage of intuition and experience to get closer and closer to our desired result. For example, in just 5
                            minutes, you can make a list of all the countries in the world and have an idea of how many there are in total. Fermi estimates are based on the order of magnitude or scale
                            instead of accuracy. </p>

                        <p> When you're building a software system, it will be very complex. You need some structure to hold things together. The term "software architecture" refers to this
                            structureâ€”the way the pieces fit together and interact. Software architecture is not the same thing as programming languages or tools; instead, it dictates how those
                            elements should be used together to create a successful product that meets business requirements and user needs while ensuring that development time and costs are kept
                            under control. </p>

                        <p> Experiments are the primary unit of work in Azure Machine Learning Studio. They allow you to track different versions of your machine-learning models and determine which is

                        <p> If you're running a business, you know there is always a need for more time and money to do everything. And this is especially true when it comes to managing your digital
                            operations. Being digitally efficient cannot be overstated â€“ it's more important than ever. Digital efficiency can be used against market volatility, customer demand, and
                            increased competition, delivering more agile, flexible, and responsive business processes. Digitally-enabled companies tend to grow faster and generate higher profits than
                            competitors that haven't made the same commitment. This is why digitization is essential for businesses of all sizes today: if you don't have suitable systems, how can you
                            expect your organization to grow? </p>

                            your unique situation. Still, some steps you can take will help you progress on any business improvement project you're working on right now. In this post, I will share

                            example of this type of inspiration is the first time someone uses Google Maps and realizes it can tell them where to goâ€”no more guessing when driving directions are
                            involved. That's a huge deal. But if you're like me, you might have noticed that some companies consistently produce products that inspire excitement in users while others
                            struggle or just don't get it right. What makes these two scenarios different? In my experience working on software projects over the past decade or so, I've learned there

                        <p> When talking about cloud-based applications, we usually talk about microservice architecture. Microservices are easier to deploy and manage than monolithic applications.
                            However, they still follow the same principles that monolithic apps have used for a long time: abstraction, encapsulation, and separation of concerns. Let's break down what
                            each of these means in the context of layered application architecture in the cloud. </p>

                        <p> It's true: social media has changed the world. And while it's easy to think of Facebook as just a place to post photos of whatever you had for lunch, there's an entire
                            world of opportunities beneath the surface. Social media can be a great way to build your audience and connect with them on a personal level, but only if you use it
                            correctly. Here are some tips for using Facebook effectively and building your audience: </p>

                        <p> As a data architect, I've seen many companies with multiple SOR. Although it is beneficial for scaling the apps, it has serious side effects. In this post, I will
                            discuss why having multiple SORs is terrible and some things you can do to mitigate them (if not eliminate them). </p>

                        <p> Regarding technology, you want to ensure you get the most out of your investments. IT expense projects are a great way to do this because they often don't require large
                            investments upfront. Instead, these projects are designed to improve efficiencies in the company and make things easier for employees. However, there is a lot more
                            opportunity here than just improving efficiency and making life easier for employees; turning expense projects into revenue-generating products is one way companies can see
                            actual returns on their technology investments. </p>

                        <p> Creating a rollout plan can help you avoid common problems with software implementation and ensure that everything goes as smoothly as possible. A rollout or completion
                            plan is a set of instructions explaining how a piece of software will be implemented in your organization. It includes important details like who will be responsible for
                            different aspects of the rollout and what steps each person needs to take. </p>

                        <p> A lot of people think APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are just an extra layer of complexity on top of the already complicated technology stack. The truth is that
                            APIs are the glue that holds your entire system together and makes it possible to interact with the various components. They can be used to create a consistent experience
                            for your users across all channels, improve efficiency by allowing multiple clients to access data at once, and make scaling easier by isolating each microservice from the
                            other. API Gateways provide all these features plus more! In this post, I'll explain what an API Gateway does and why it's essential for every company doing digital
                            transformation projects. </p>

                        <p> What if your website was slow? Would you notice? Would it affect how you view the brand as a whole? The answer to that question is yes. But what if I told you that this
                            problem could cost your business money? It's trueâ€”the speed of your website significantly impacts how customers interact with your brand and whether or not they choose to
                            purchase from you. </p>
