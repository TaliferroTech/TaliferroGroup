                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> Security is an essential aspect of any business that relies on information technology and digital transformation. Even if you're using a third-party platform, you're
                                still responsible for the security of your data. With the increasing number of cyber-attacks and data breaches, neglecting security can have severe consequences for
                                your business. </p>
                            <p> The rate at which security is being neglected is alarming. According to a recent report by IBM, the average data breach cost is $3.86 million. This cost includes the
                                expenses associated with investigating the breach, notifying affected parties, and implementing measures to prevent future violations. The report also found that the
                                longer it takes to identify and contain a breach, the more costly it becomes. </p>
                            <p> You're signing up for liability when you neglect the security of your information technology and digital transformation. If your business suffers a data breach, you may
                                be liable for any damages caused to your customers or partners. This can result in legal action, business loss, and reputation damage. </p>
                            <p> Here are some steps to ensure the security of your information technology and digital transformation. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Conduct regular security assessments </h2>
                            <p> Regular security assessments can help you identify vulnerabilities in your systems and processes. These assessments should be conducted by qualified professionals who
                                can identify potential threats and recommend mitigating them. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Implement a security framework </h2>
                            <p> Implementing a security framework, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, can help you establish a comprehensive
                                security program. The framework provides guidelines for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber threats. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Train your employees </h2>
                            <p> Your employees are your first line of defense against cyber threats. Providing regular training on cybersecurity best practices can help them identify and prevent
                                potential threats. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Monitor your systems </h2>
                            <p> Monitoring your systems and applications can help you identify potential threats before they become a problem. This can include monitoring <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=478548468582b9fce471d3481015a0bc&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=172504">network</a> traffic, log files,
                                and user activity. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> Neglecting the security of your information technology and digital transformation can have severe consequences for your business. Even if you're using a third-party
                                platform, you're still responsible for the security of your data. By implementing the steps outlined above, you can help ensure the safety of your systems and protect
                                your business from potential liabilities. </p>
