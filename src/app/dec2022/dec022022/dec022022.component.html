                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> A lot of people think APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are just an extra layer of complexity on top of the already complicated technology stack. The truth is
                                that APIs are the glue that holds your entire system together and makes it possible to interact with the various components. They can be used to create a consistent
                                experience for your users across all channels, improve efficiency by allowing multiple clients to access data at once, and make scaling easier by isolating each
                                microservice from the other. API Gateways provide all these features plus more! In this post, I'll explain what an API Gateway does and why it's essential for every
                                company doing digital transformation projects. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> A single point of entry </h2>
                            <p> An API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests. This makes your APIs easier to manage and reduces the chances of exposing an API endpoint designed for
                                internal use and accidentally made public. </p>
                            <p> Since you need only one gateway entry point, there's no need for failover for a single point of failure or load balancing across multiple endpoints. This also makes it
                                easier to scale out your service as demand increases without worrying about adding additional internal infrastructures like load balancers or proxies. </p>
                            <p> A well-designed API Gateway will provide security features such as authentication and authorization policies with pre-built rules that can be customized based on your
                                needs (e.g., user roles). </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Automatic load balancing </h2>
                            <p> Automatic load balancing is a critical feature of an API Gateway. It ensures that your service will be highly available and always provide the same performance for your
                                users, regardless of the infrastructure or location where they are accessing it from. The load balancer distributes requests between multiple servers, ensuring high
                                availability. </p>
                            <p> If you're using an AWS Lambda function to handle client requests, you can easily set up a CloudWatch alarm on the function's CPU usage. This will trigger if there is
                                any spike in CPU usage for more than 5 minutes or 25% above normal levels over 24 hours. Suppose one instance becomes overloaded with requests, causing CPU consumption
                                to increase beyond acceptable limits. In that case, Amazon Web Services will automatically fail over to another instance without any manual intervention required. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Decoupling and isolation between the client and microservices </h2>
                            <p> The API Gateway can be used to decouple and isolate between the client and microservices. Microservices are a way to build applications by breaking them into smaller,
                                more manageable pieces. If one part of your application stops working, it doesn't take down the whole thing. </p>
                            <p> The API Gateway can help manage microservices since it allows you to add authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. It is useful when you have multiple services
                                that need these features applied across them all. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Mediation </h2>
                            <p> If you have an API Gateway, you can use it to enforce the policy. For example, you can use a gateway to log and monitor all requests. This is especially useful if
                                multiple teams and third-party developers use your services. You can also use a gateway to protect your services from malicious clients or bad actors. The point is that
                                having one single entry point into your microservices architecture (i.e., the gateway) allows you more control over security and policy enforcement across all of your
                                APIs. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Traffic Management </h2>
                            <p> Traffic management is a crucial feature of an API Gateway, which you'll likely use frequently. Traffic management controls the number of calls allowed to your service
                                in a given period. It can be used to throttle incoming calls, prevent overloading the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3a64388bbe76b2957e6be89844c315e6&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=11036071">server</a> by limiting the number of concurrent requests, or track usage patterns.
                            </p>
                            <p> Traffic management also allows you to control access based on IP address, ensuring that only authorized users have access to your dataâ€”and that no one else can view it.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Security </h2>
                            <p> Security is one of the critical benefits of having an API Gateway. You can use it to secure your APIs by implementing authentication, authorization, and other security
                                features like SSL termination or proxy servers. </p>
                            <p> Another benefit of using an API Gateway to secure your APIs is that it allows you to implement security protocols like OAuth (Open Authorization). </p>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> In conclusion, you see that having an API Gateway has many advantages for your microservices architecture. It provides a single point of entry to your services, which
                                allows them to be decoupled and isolated from each other. This means you can make changes without worrying about affecting other parts of the system. It also supports
                                automatic load balancing and mediation with traffic management capabilities such as CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Finally, it provides security through its
                                ability to handle authentication requests before forwarding them back again to their destination(s). </p>
