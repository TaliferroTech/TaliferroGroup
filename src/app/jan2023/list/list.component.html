                            I've been looking at startup investments for years, and I've seen many failures. I'm sure it's not fun to lose money, but it's even worse when your friend or neighbor loses money on a project they were excited about. You might think that would be enough to convince investors to diversify their portfolios and avoid investing with people they know well - but you'd be wrong. Most VCs still focus almost all of their attention on deals involving people they already know well.

                            If you're a Black person in the technology industry, you probably often feel like an outsider in software delivery. The field is overwhelmingly white and male, and finding role models or mentors who look like yourself can be difficult. However, despite these challenges, I have learned to embrace my unique perspective and use it to bring a fresh perspective to the software delivery process.

                            API design is often overlooked, but offering a prosperous API is essential. An API that's difficult to use or doesn't make sense will frustrate developers and fail to give them what they need to build the apps they want. By following the tips below, you can ensure that your API succeeds by being easy to understand and use.

                            I am a fan of continuous integration and continuous deployment. It's a great way to build software, and it can make the difference between having an <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a> team and just thinking they are <a routerLink="/agile-coaching">agile</a>. Many projects say they do CI/CD when really they don't even have primary CI in place, which is unfortunate because it makes all of our jobs harder and creates more work for everyone involved.

                            A laboratory information management system (LIMS) is a software tool that helps you organize and manage your lab's data. It can help you track what you've done, what you're doing, and what's left to do. As an integral part of the scientific process, LIMS can help your lab run more efficiently and cost-effectively. If you're considering buying a LIMS or implementing one at your facility, read on for everything you need to know about this valuable tool!

                            CRMs have come a long way from storing customer information in shoe boxes in their early days. These days, there are so many different CRM options available that it can be challenging to choose the right one for your business. Several important factors to consider when selecting a CRM include how much you can spend on it and how hard you want it to be for staff members to use.

                            We've all heard the old saying, "We don't know what we don't know." That's as true in business as it is in life. Organizations often miss opportunities for growth because they need to be fully aware of their finances. A recent survey by Gartner found that many businesses still view IT expenses as just another cost of doing business -- not an investment that can lead to increased revenue generation and performance. But the reality is this: Companies that see software and services as vehicles for growth are three times more likely than others to be high performers on vital financial measures such as operating margin and return on equity (ROE).

                            If you're a good salesperson looking for a sales job, you should be willing to prove that you can sell and work for free in the first few months, as long as the reward is a big salary. This may seem like a bold statement, but it's one that many successful salespeople have proven to be true. Plus, there is no way an employer can determine if they have selected a good salesperson. Small companies that need good salespeople take a significant risk and have limited reserves to waste.

                            Establishing trust with your clients is essential for any business, regardless of the industry. When clients trust you and your business, they are more likely to work with you again, refer you to others, and provide valuable feedback. Building trust takes time and effort, but the benefits are well worth it.

                            Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field that has the potential to revolutionize many industries. It is often associated with creating machines that think and reason like humans. However, the reality is that the form of AI currently being developed and used is more about pattern recognition than human intelligence.

                            When I first joined the consulting world, I was excited and energetic, eager to make a difference and do what was best for the organization. I had high hopes for the future and believed that my ideas and suggestions would be welcomed with open arms. However, my optimism was quickly met with reality when I discovered that things were not as simple as I had imagined.

                            A slow-performing e-commerce website can be a significant source of frustration for both the business owner and the customer. Not only can it lead to poor user experience, but it can also directly impact the bottom line by causing a loss of revenue. This post will explore how a slow e-commerce website can cost money and how the loss is calculated.
