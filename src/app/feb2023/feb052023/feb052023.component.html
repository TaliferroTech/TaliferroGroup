<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    E-Commerce is a huge part of the world economy, but it's going nowhere. It's about to change in ways we couldn't have predicted even five years ago. In this post, I will look at what changes are happening now and what may happen in the future.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    e-Commerce today
</h2>
<p>
    The <a routerLink="/e-commerce-architecture">e-commerce</a> market is a $3 trillion industry, with Amazon being the most significant player in the space. The online shopping experience has changed significantly over the past decade, and it will only continue evolving as technology improves and consumers demand more personalized experiences.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Online & Offline have blurred further
</h2>
<u>
    <li>
        We are seeing more and more online stores opening physical stores

    </li>
    <li>
        We are witnessing physical stores offering online sale

    </li>
    <li>
        Online stores offer in-store returns, which was previously unheard of in eCommerce
    </li>
    <li>
        Physical stores providing digital services such as printing photos or scanning documents
    </li>
</u>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Mobile Payments are the norm
</h2>
<p>
    Consumers have come to expect mobile payments as the easiest way to pay for goods and services, and they will continue to do so in 2023. Mobile payments are convenient and easy to use, which makes them a popular choice among consumers.
    In addition, more people are using mobile payments than ever before:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        U.S.-based consumers spent trillions through their phones
    </li>
    <li>
        Globally, there were billions active users of payment apps 
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Returns
</h2>
<p>
    This is a big one, but it's essential to understand why this has happened and how it affects your business. Customers expect to be able to return goods without any hassle, and they view the ability to do so as a sign of good customer service. If you don't offer returns on your products, customers will likely go elsewhere in search of one that does, and they will be open about telling their friends!
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    e-Commerce is mainstream
</h2>
<p>
    It's no longer just for the tech-savvy, young, and affluent. It's a viable option for everyone, from those with little money to invest to retirees who want to supplement their income by selling things online.
</p>
<p>
    The millennial generation has grown up with it and has become masters at comparison shopping and buying on mobile devices. They see online shopping as normal and even prefer it over brick-and-mortar stores because they don't have to wait in line or deal with crowds when they need something immediately.

</p>
<p>
    Baby boomers are turning 65 at a rate of 10,000 per day in America alone. These seniors tend to be more comfortable using computers than younger generations; many also have more free time on their hands thanks to retirement, so making extra cash by selling items through <a routerLink="/e-commerce-architecture">e-commerce</a> platforms like eBay or Amazon makes sense.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    In 2023, e-Commerce still exists, but in a new way
</h2>
<p>
    In 2023, e-Commerce still exists, but in a new way. E-commerce is no longer just buying products online; it's a way of life. People are constantly connected to their devices and feel more comfortable shopping on their phones than going into stores.
</p>
<p>
    There's also been an increase in social media platforms that allow people to share how much money they spent on something or where they got it from, which can influence others' purchasing decisions.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Quick checkout

</h2>
<p>
    The convenience of a quick checkout is for more than just Amazon. Many retailers offer similar services, including Best Buy and Walmart. If you're shopping on their websites or mobile apps and have an account with the retailer, all it takes is one click to complete your purchase and get out of there!
</p>
<p>
    If this sounds too good to be true, that's because it is--sort of. While these processes are much simpler than traditional <a routerLink="/e-commerce-architecture">e-commerce</a> checkouts (which require multiple steps), they do require some setup ahead of time:
</p>
<p>
    You need to create an account with each website/app before using the quick checkout feature; otherwise, you'll have to enter all your information manually every time. This will take a little bit of time but can still be annoying if all you want is convenience now!
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Checkout is an App, not a website

</h2>
<p>
    The checkout process is seamless and integrated into the customer journey. The consumer has been educated by their previous interactions with your brand and knows exactly what to expect when they reach this point in their journey with you. It's also an excellent opportunity for you to communicate with them to gather feedback or make recommendations based on past purchases or interests.

</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Affiliate marketing to advertise and sell your product
</h2>
<p>
    Affiliate marketing is a form of online marketing in which an online business rewards one or more affiliates for each visitor or customer brought by their marketing efforts.
</p>
<p>
    Affiliate programs are used by some of the world's largest, most profitable companies, including Amazon, eBay, and Walmart.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Omnichannel 
</h2>
<p>
    Omnichannel will be the norm rather than anything else.
    Omnichannel means shopping online and in-store or using multiple channels to buy a product or get information about it. For example, if you're looking for some shoes online but can't find what you want at first glance, you may go into a physical store where they have more options available so that you can try them on before making your final decision. This is an example of how omnichannel works today: people are using different channels at once while shopping online to quickly get what they need with minimum effort (and maximum convenience).
</p>
<p>
    Consumers expect to pay for value-added services like same-day shipping, free returns, and free delivery but also want a more personalized service. They are willing to pay more where they feel they get more incredible value.
</p>
<p>
    The trend is for consumers to be more discerning about the brands they buy from and what they buy from those brands. The days of one-size-fits are over; consumers now want choice in how they shop, whether through product choice or service options on top of their purchase transaction (such as free delivery).
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Huge changes in e-commerce
</h2>
<p>
    We have seen considerable changes in <a routerLink="/e-commerce-architecture">e-commerce</a>, but we are just scratching the surface. The future of <a routerLink="/e-commerce-architecture">e-commerce</a> is still to be written and will continue to evolve as new technologies emerge and improve upon what we have today.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    I expect even more disruption in 2023 with new technologies and innovations that will change how we shop online forever.
