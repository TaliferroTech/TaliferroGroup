                            The recent article by Venture Beat, titled "<a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/report-shows-92-of-orgs-experienced-an-api-security-incident-last-year/">Report shows 92% of organizations experienced an API security incident last year</a>," sheds light on the precarious state of API security across numerous organizations. The Enterprise Strategy Group survey of 397 respondents revealed that a staggering 92% of organizations encountered at least one API-related security incident in the past year. Furthermore, 57% of the surveyed organizations experienced multiple API security incidents, and 75% updated their APIs daily or weekly. This opinion piece posits that organizations frequently regard security as an afterthought, and the lack of governance or expertise exacerbates the situation. Moreover, even when organizations employ security experts, they often dismiss their valuable insights, resulting in a precarious security landscape.

                            In the hallowed halls of Accenture, the illustrious corporation renowned for its prowess in professional services, there transpired a comical incident that elucidated the complexities of yearning for a secretary in the modern corporate milieu. On that fateful day, I, a humble cog in the vast machinery of Accenture, experienced the unbridled mockery of my esteemed colleagues, their derision fueled by my fervent desire for a secretary – a seemingly mundane aspiration that, unbeknownst to me, would ignite a firestorm of jest and jocularity.

                            In the twilight of my life, I often reflect upon the past, contemplating the numerous paths not taken and the myriad opportunities forsaken. One pervasive thought that haunts me as a specter of the past is the unfulfilled ambition of working for two of the most illustrious technology giants in the world - Microsoft and Apple. At 62, one of my top ten biggest regrets remains my inability to join the ranks of these behemoths of innovation during my years of professional exuberance.

                            Getting a job can be a difficult task, and it can be incredibly challenging for minorities, particularly Black people. Despite the various measures that have been taken to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, many Black people still face barriers when it comes to finding employment. One of the most significant factors contributing to this disparity is networking, which is often described as "who you know" rather than "what you know." This means that a person's chances of finding employment are significantly influenced by their network and connections.

                            Implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system can be a transformative endeavor for any organization, streamlining business processes, enhancing efficiency, and promoting data-driven decision-making. However, the journey toward a successful ERP implementation is often fraught with challenges and pitfalls that can hinder progress and jeopardize the project's success. This article aims to delineate the intricacies of ERP implementation and provide guidance on evading common pitfalls, ultimately facilitating a smooth and effective transition.

                            In 2007, I was a bright-eyed Accenture project manager overseeing Microsoft's Commerce Server development. My mission: to manage the Cactus Commerce development team based in the frosty city of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. This wild adventure had me jet-setting from the sun-soaked beaches of Miami to the icy tundras of Canada every week, and it was nothing short of a hilarious rollercoaster ride.

                            Once upon a time, in the hallowed halls of academia, where the future API architects and luminaries of our digital world were nurtured, a series of utterly calamitous and, dare I say, amusing design practices were born. It is said that laughter is the best medicine, so let us embark on a jovial journey, exploring the buffoonery of some ill-fated API design practices that, if not for their comical nature, might have left us in tears.

                            It was a typical evening when I decided to take a break from my daily tasks and delve into the world of YouTube. Little did I know that I was about to stumble upon an unsettling revelation that would change my perception of some of the brightest young minds in the business world. I clicked on a video that promised to unveil the dark secrets lurking beneath the glamorous façade of Fortune's 30 under 30. As the video played, I learned that many of these prodigies had turned to criminal activities, leveraging their brilliance for nefarious purposes. Shocked and intrigued, I couldn't help but wonder how these young stars had strayed so far from the path of success and into the realm of crime. This revelation led me to uncover the truth behind their descent into darkness, reshaping my understanding of success and the moral compass of those who achieve it.

                            In an increasingly digital world, technology constantly evolves and becomes more complex. With countless devices, applications, and software programs, it can be challenging to determine which ones best suit our needs. Enter artificial intelligence (AI) - an advanced technology that has the potential to serve as a personalized technology advisor. This blog post will explore how AI can revolutionize our interactions with technology by helping us make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, and better understand our preferences.

                            In the contemporary digital communication landscape, the term "REST API" has become virtually ubiquitous, permeating the lexicon of developers and technologists alike. However, this seemingly innocuous phrase harbors a fundamental incongruity that belies the original intent of its progenitor, Roy Fielding. In this post, I shall delve into the reasons for my aversion to the term "REST API," examine the conceptual distinctions between API and REST and elucidate the implications of this misnomer within web-based communication.

                            Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a vanguard of technological advancement, permeating various sectors and engendering remarkable transformations in our quotidian lives. AI systems have bolstered human endeavors with unparalleled efficiency, from expediting medical diagnoses to facilitating instantaneous communication across vast distances. Nevertheless, the precipitous adoption of AI is not without its caveats; as our reliance on these sophisticated systems burgeons, so too do the unintended consequences that may arise from their deployment. It is incumbent upon us, therefore, to scrutinize these ramifications with assiduousness and rigor.
