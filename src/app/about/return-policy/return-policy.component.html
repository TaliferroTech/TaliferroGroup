                                satisfied with them. We'll always do our best to take care of customers—our philosophy is to deal with them fairly and reasonably. We have long believed that when we
                                treat our customers fairly, they in turn are fair with us. We apply refunds to the tender with which returned items were purchased. If we choose to provide a refund and
                                no record of sale is available, we'll ask for personal identification and a refund will be provided at the current price. </p>
