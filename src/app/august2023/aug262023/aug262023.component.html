                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Introduction </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Growing up with dreams of being a television cameraman, specifically to operate a TV camera during a Cubs game, I embarked on a journey full of
                                twists and turns. From attending Columbia College in Chicago to getting a glimpse of the corporate ladder at CBS, my youthful ambition was challenged by the realization
                                of what it would take to get there - a 20-year wait for a "maybe." </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> So I chose a different path, one that led me to Data Processing after a calculated analysis of the job market. My journey continued with an
                                accelerated program at DeVry Institute of Technology and a parallel aspiration of becoming a musician. Eventually, Data Processing won, and I settled into a career
                                marked by ups and downs, reorganizations, and encounters with racism that I often failed to recognize at the time. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> But the struggles and disillusionments I faced in my career mirrored a larger issue, one that extends to the very fabric of corporate America and
                                its relationship with minority entrepreneurs. Many companies claim to have minority supplier programs, designed to level the playing field. Yet, like my experience of
                                trying to climb the corporate ladder, these programs often turn out to be a facade, a series of never-ending hoops that minority suppliers are made to jump through.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> These so-called minority supplier programs keep promising opportunities for minority entrepreneurs but deliver little more than broken links and
                                dead ends. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Most minority suppliers to these companies are not really minority suppliers. The system is rigged, making it nearly impossible to do business.
                                It's a metaphor for the challenges and injustices I've faced in my career and a stark reminder of how dreams can be derailed by systems designed to maintain the status
                                quo. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> I'm really poor at picking out racism, and I've learned to navigate a world that doesn't always play fair. That leads me to this story, a story of
                                dreams, perseverance, and the harsh realities of how the game is often played. This is my experience embarking on the journey of becoming a minority supplier,
                                highlighting the challenges I encountered. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Embracing Opportunity </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> When a persuasive friend encouraged me to explore minority supplier programs, I was initially hesitant. My partner and I were wary of being labeled
                                as "disadvantaged" or having our achievements undermined. However, our friend pointed out the potential financial gains we missed. Intrigued, we decided to take the
                                plunge and registered with the Washington State Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprise (MWBE), a step we anticipated with mixed feelings. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> The Hilarious Paradox </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Our first step towards becoming a recognized minority supplier involved registering with the Washington State Office of Minority and Women's
                                Business Enterprise. The process, however, held an unexpected element of amusement. To assert our minority status, we found ourselves in the ironic position of paying a
                                fee and submitting various documents to a predominantly white organization. The situation's absurdity did not escape us, but we persevered and completed the necessary
                                paperwork, eagerly awaiting the certification outcome. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Despite the amusing nature of the process, we recognized the importance of certification. It serves as a means to supposedly access various
                                opportunities and benefits available to minority and women-owned businesses. By pursuing certification, we aimed to establish our presence and credibility within the
                                business landscape while positioning ourselves for future collaborations and growth. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> With the paperwork submitted, we now find ourselves in a waiting game, anticipating the "certified" status to validate our position as a minority
                                supplier further. Ideally, this crucial recognition should enhance our professional profile and enable us to tap into a network of like-minded businesses and establish
                                connections that foster mutual success. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> By participating in programs like the Washington State Office of Minority and Women's Business Enterprise, we actively promote diversity, equity,
                                and inclusivity within the business community. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> We've been waiting for certification for over a month now, which might seem humorous to those not in the know, especially considering the
                                relatively small Black population in the state of Washington. The idea of a waiting queue for certification in this context almost seems absurd. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Adding to the confusion, I've heard that most of the minority supplier certifications actually go to white women. This begs the question: Wasn't
                                this program intended to level the playing field for Black people specifically? Though I might be mistaken, I recently came across information suggesting that less than
                                1% of the businesses certified are Black-owned, a statistic that is likely even more dire for Black-owned tech companies. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> I won't dwell on this point, but it's one of those revelations that boggles the mind, leaving you wondering what on earth is happening with the
                                system that's supposed to be providing support and equality. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> The Quest for Opportunities </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Filled with optimism and enthusiasm, we conducted an extensive Google search to find companies embracing minority supplier programs. The abundance
                                of organizations supposedly committed to diversity and inclusion filled us with excitement and potential for growth and collaboration. We eagerly submitted
                                applications, viewing them as gateways to meaningful partnerships. Each application submission represented our determination to seize opportunities and make a mark in
                                business. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Unveiling the Intricacies </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Among the companies we approached, American Express presented an intriguing process. Their application required disclosure of participation in the
                                byblack program, a qualification we did not possess at the time. Intrigued by the program's unique approach, we enrolled, only to discover that the registration process
                                resembled an interview to assess our eligibility. Hours were spent meticulously crafting video responses, a daunting task for small businesses with limited resources.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Although we understood the need for thorough evaluations, we couldn't help but feel frustrated by the lack of consideration for applicants' time
                                and resources. As small business owners, we struggled to find the two hours required to complete an application. User-friendliness was not prioritized in the design of
                                the registration process, leading to hurdles for entrepreneurs like ourselves. We now find ourselves eagerly awaiting approval, hoping that our efforts will be
                                recognized. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> The ByBlack program is beginning to feel like another endless cycle, a hamster wheel of waiting and uncertainty. We've been waiting for over a
                                month now for approval, despite having made our status clear through a video. I've reached out through emails and messages, yet have received not a single response. The
                                discrepancy between the effort required from the applicant and the level of communication from the program is glaringly disproportionate. Entrepreneurs like us don't
                                have time to spare, and being subjected to such an extensive interview process without any communication is not only frustrating but downright absurd. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Another interesting process was the mighty Chase Bank. Hold your breath for this plot twist - after receiving ten approvals from various companies,
                                our beloved Chase gave us a good old rejection. Can you believe it? The bank we trust with our hard-earned money, the one we waltz into regularly, and the same folks
                                with all our banking records decided we don't fit the bill as a minority supplier. The irony! They must have momentarily forgotten our faces. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As we eagerly awaited responses to our applications, the thrill of becoming certified minority suppliers was accompanied by a curious challenge. We
                                realized that companies did not proactively notify us of our status. Instead, it was up to us to log in and discover our fate. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Our first application was to KPMG, a consulting company that seemed like an ideal match for our specific skillset. Furthermore, T-Mobile personnel
                                had expressed a keen interest in working with us, recognizing the value of our security knowledge. However, after two weeks without a response, I contacted KPMG
                                directly, seeking clarification on the next steps now that we had been approved as a minority supplier. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> To my surprise, the email I received in response provided little clarity. It simply stated that they would reach out when a suitable project became
                                available. This left me perplexed since I had explicitly mentioned a suitable project involving T-Mobile in my initial application. It seemed like the connection had
                                not been established, and I wondered if my message had been overlooked or misunderstood. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> While we were elated to receive approvals, the lack of guidance and proactive communication from companies left us uncertain about the next course
                                of action. We had hoped that our initial application, clearly outlining potential projects, would lead to more targeted and specific conversations. It did not! </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Navigating Uncertainty and Limited Opportunities within Minority Supplier Programs </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> My next attempt to contact Accenture shed light on an unsettling reality - confusion seemed to prevail when it came to understanding their minority
                                supplier program. Even their internal help system failed to provide any clarity. This raised suspicions in my mind. Were these programs truly genuine? To seek answers,
                                I reached out to executives from Microsoft, Caterpillar, Okta, and Accenture, hoping they could shed light on the process of being considered for projects as a minority
                                supplier. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> To my dismay, even within KPMG, Accenture and EY, no one clearly understood how the program functioned. The responses I received from Microsoft and
                                Caterpillar were the most interesting, albeit disheartening. They expressed that these programs often amounted to mere public relations gestures, lacking substantial
                                opportunities for minority suppliers. It became apparent that whenever there was a request for proposal (RFP) or project, Accenture or McKinsey were the preferred
                                choices, leaving little to no room for other companies to participate. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> For example the person I spoke with someone who works at Microsoft - off the record but in all honesty - they said “that’s just a government check
                                box - you’ll never get in” </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> And yet another person I spoke with who works in leadership at Caterpillar said in casual conversation after I asked if I could work with him “my
                                hands are tied, I can only work with either Accenture or McKinsey and even if you get in, you’ll have to go through a 6 months to a year vetting process” </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> These were said to my face or over the phone - in confidence I might add - however most of the messages I got on LinkedIn start with “Here’s my
                                off-the-record perspective”. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As I heard these discouraging accounts, my belief in the system's fairness wavered, yet I was determined to explore further. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> I began engaging in email correspondence and conversations with individuals responsible for managing minority supplier programs in various
                                companies. It became apparent that without a presence on Gartner's recommended vendor list, the chances of success as a minority supplier were zero. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> To understand the process better, I asked companies where I could access a website portal or procurement email to submit proposals for the projects
                                they needed assistance with, especially since I had already been approved as a supplier. To my disappointment, no company provided a means to submit a proposal. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> This journey highlights the challenges faced by minority suppliers in gaining access to substantial opportunities within these programs. Despite
                                being approved and certified, it became evident that the system favored established players like Accenture and McKinsey. The need for more transparency and avenues for
                                proposal submissions created a frustrating cycle of limited prospects. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Nevertheless, my belief in the potential of humankind and the power of persistence continues to motivate me. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> The Desire for Alternative Options and the Challenge for Boutique Consulting Agencies </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Interestingly, in my conversations, many executives express dissatisfaction with the technology results they obtain from larger companies. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> They yearn for the opportunity to engage smaller suppliers, even if just to receive a second opinion. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Just take a moment to browse through the websites of most large companies, and you'll likely notice an outdated and frustrating user experience.
                                Believe it or not, millions are often spent on these clunky interfaces. But the shortcomings don't end with corporate websites; let's talk about Government sites. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> If you've ever interacted with a Government website, you've likely been met with a design that seems frozen in the early 2000s. Broken links, "404
                                not found" errors, and help sections that never seem to match the actual page they're referring to create a nightmarish navigation experience. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> What's even more baffling is that most executives are aware of these problems. Many would love to bring in fresh eyes to overhaul these systems,
                                but instead, they find themselves trapped in a cycle of spending millions with big agencies. The result? The same mistakes are repeated, time and time again, leading to
                                frustration for users and a lack of progress in improving online experiences. It's a situation that begs for innovation and change, yet somehow remains mired in
                                outdated practices and wasted resources. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As one Executive put it “We have several minority businesses who have pitched us in this same space, and we would like to work with them, so the
                                interest is definitely there to find a way to work with diverse suppliers.” </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Having previously worked at Accenture and Wipro, I became aware that the primary focus was not necessarily to assist companies. Instead, a
                                significant portion of the work is delegated to junior-level staff with less than two years of experience. While senior consultants contribute to the design and overall
                                vision, the actual execution often falls into the hands of these junior consultants. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As a minority supplier, and one who has already received approval, the reality appears stark: the chances of working with a large company,
                                especially as a boutique consulting agency, is nonexistent. This notion stems from the prevailing belief that established consulting firms, such as Accenture and
                                McKinsey, monopolize the opportunities within these organizations. Consequently, the desire for diversity and fresh perspectives that executives yearn for remains
                                unfulfilled. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> It's natural to question how companies can boast about engaging with minority suppliers or claim significant spending with them. The reality,
                                however, may be far from what meets the eye. What I learned is many organizations don't genuinely collaborate with minority suppliers to the extent they advertise.
                                Instead, they often resort to deceptive tactics, such as doing business with a recently established shell company with a minority or woman figurehead, obtaining
                                certification for these entities, and presenting them as legitimate minority-owned suppliers. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> In this scenario, the individual representing the shell company receives only a small percentage of the revenue as a token for their role. On the
                                other hand, the lion's share of the profits flows into the coffers of larger companies, such as Accenture and McKinsey. This practice raises serious concerns about the
                                authenticity and transparency of claims regarding minority supplier engagement. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> While it is challenging to determine the prevalence of such practices, I have encountered multiple instances where I was explicitly directed to
                                engage with Accenture or McKinsey if I desired work opportunities. Even then, the process of being vetted as a genuine boutique minority supplier proved to be arduous
                                and demanding. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> This situation presents a significant challenge for boutique consulting agencies striving to break into the corporate landscape. Despite being
                                certified and approved as a minority supplier, the barriers to entry are insurmountable. The limited avenues for engagement with large companies further restrict the
                                ability of these agencies to showcase their expertise and provide valuable insights. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As executives continue expressing dissatisfaction with the status quo, the demand for alternative options and diversity in supplier choices may
                                gain momentum. This presents an opportunity for minority suppliers, including boutique consulting agencies, to advocate for equal consideration and demonstrate the
                                unique value they bring to the table. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> In pursuing a more inclusive business ecosystem, executives and decision-makers must recognize the potential benefits that smaller, diverse
                                suppliers can offer. By fostering an environment that encourages diversity, innovation, and collaboration, both large companies and minority suppliers can contribute to
                                a more vibrant and equitable marketplace. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize wow fadeInUp"> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> As we await minority supplier certification and responses from various minority supplier programs, we are left to pursue other avenues of entry
                                into major companies because these programs often prove to be mere facades. This experience has illuminated some vital lessons and offered insight into areas that
                                demand immediate attention. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Firstly, it's crucial for companies offering minority supplier programs to ensure that their procedures are transparent, accessible, and efficient.
                                The prolonged waiting periods and opaque processes that we've encountered not only hinder progress but foster mistrust. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Secondly, companies should actively work to dismantle the barriers that keep genuine minority suppliers at arm's length. This means eradicating
                                superficial quotas and genuinely committing to fostering diversity within their supplier base. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Thirdly, communication is vital. Keeping applicants informed about the status of their applications and providing clear guidelines after approval
                                can significantly enhance the experience for minority suppliers attempting to navigate these often-complex procedures. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> One valuable insight that emerged from our journey is the importance of having an internal champion within the company. After receiving approval,
                                minority suppliers must often still navigate the complexities of the corporate structure. Matching them with a supportive internal advocate can be invaluable in this
                                process. This champion can establish a relationship with the minority supplier, guiding and supporting them as they seek to make a meaningful contribution to the
                                company's success. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Lastly, companies must recognize that promoting diversity goes beyond mere token gestures. It requires a committed, systematic approach that aligns
                                with core business values and reflects a genuine desire to engage with diverse communities. </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp"> Hopefully, by engaging people in positions of power within Diversity and Inclusion programs and cultivating relationships with internal champions,
                                we can work around these roadblocks and pave the way for growth and success as minority suppliers in the locked-down business arena. But it's time for corporations to
                                step up and truly embrace the change that goes beyond mere compliance or public relations exercises. Real change can only come when there is a sincere commitment to
                                rethinking these programs, based on the real experiences of those they are meant to serve. This transformation will require deliberate effort and a genuine willingness
                                to adapt and grow. </p>
