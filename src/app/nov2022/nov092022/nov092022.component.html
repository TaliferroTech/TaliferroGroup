                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> Hacking is a huge problem, but it's not something most people think about. The truth is that hacking into most companies and websites is easy - they're not hacked
                                because most people are good people.  </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Securing systems </h2>
                            <p> Most companies and websites need to do a better job of securing their systems. This is because most people don't care about security, don't know how to secure their
                                systems, or don't understand the importance of safety. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Hacking is easy </h2>
                            <p> Hacking is not something that only the best can do. It's not a skill limited to the elite and doesn't take years of training. Anyone can learn how to hack with enough
                                time and effort. However, hacking is easy because most people don't have any security measures on their websites or device. If you are an average person, who isn't
                                looking out for malicious hackers trying to gain access to your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=cb303e3e6bde4143072cb5efaabcc9b3&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=565098">computer</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=478548468582b9fce471d3481015a0bc&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=172504">network</a>, you will be hacked without knowing it until it's too late! It's the only way to
                                keep hackers out. </p>
                            <p> You can't stop hackers from trying to get into your system, but you can make it as hard as possible for the bad guys. The best way to do this is by having a solid
                                password. A strong password is unique, not easily guessable, and has at least eight characters. If you're going to be using any of those words in your password, then
                                there's nothing anyone here can do for you! That means no 1234567890 or qwertyuiopzxcvbnm, but also no "password." </p>
                            <p> You'll be surprised how many people will help you in your quest. </p>
                            <p> It's not maliciousness, and it's ignorance. People just don't know better. </p>
                            <p> The least secure part of any company's IT systems is often its staff. </p>
                            <p> If you are a security researcher, you can often find out a lot about a company by looking at its website. For example, if an outside consultant has designed the
                                website, this consultant will likely have access to sensitive information such as passwords and employee records. If the staff is developing the site, they may have
                                access to this information. </p>
                            <p> As we saw in the case of Ashley Madison, it's not uncommon for some websites' employees to see what users are doing while they're logged in (this includes viewing
                                private messages between users and sending emails). Suppose someone wants your personal information or credit card number while doing other things on your account (like
                                browsing cat videos!). In that case, they could quickly get it without needing special hacking skills! </p>
                            <p> Hackers also come from all different backgrounds - there isn't a single profile for a hacker. </p>
                            <p> You may have heard that hackers are primarily young men, but this is different. Many women and older people use their knowledge and experience to get into systems. And
                                most importantlyâ€”hackers come from all different backgrounds. I know many people who've hacked into websites or databases without knowing how to code or write a
                                program! It's not easy to do if you don't see what you're doing, but anyone can do it with enough determination and curiosity (and if they know what they're doing).
                            </p>
                            <p> Once again, it's not that most people are bad - it's that most people are lazy and naive. </p>
                            <p> The world is not divided between good and evil. There are no villains or heroes. Instead, some people try to do the right thing, and others don't. It's as simple as
                                that, but while many people understand this in their daily lives, they forget it when it comes to hacking. </p>
                            <p> Somehow we think of hackers as evil geniuses who spend every waking moment thinking of new ways to steal our money or ruin our lives - but honestly, most of them get
                                bored during a slow day at work and decide to hunt down some easy targets online. And if your site isn't secure? You're an easy target! </p>
                            <p> Don't ever think that hacking is complex or challenging to get into - it's not! </p>
                            <p> It's easy to hack into a site, but you need time. Here are some things you can do: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Study the website. What kind of information is it providing? Is it worth hacking into? Are there any flaws in their security system that would make this easier for
                                    you? </li>
                                <li> Try to find out as much as possible about the people who run the website. This will help you know what kind of information they might have or what they like doing
                                    or talking about (for example, if they have recently been on vacation). It also helps if they seem exciting and stupid (for example, if all of their passwords are
                                    "1234"). </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> This post has helped to demystify hacking and security breaches. The truth is that most companies and websites do an abysmal job of securing their systems. Hacking is
                                easy, and it's not just the work of criminals! Most people have the potential to hack - they need some time (and maybe some help from their friends). </p>
