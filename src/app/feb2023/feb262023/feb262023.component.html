<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    TypeScript is a programming language widely used for building large-scale applications, especially those involving web development. Like any other programming language, TypeScript provides developers with various tools and techniques for creating high-quality software. Software design patterns are essential tools in the TypeScript developer's toolkit.
    Software design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. They help developers write more maintainable, reusable, and extensible code. This article will look at some of the basic software design patterns in TypeScript.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Singleton pattern 
</h2>
<p>
    The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access. This pattern is useful when you need only one instance of a class, for example, when working with a database connection or a logger. In TypeScript, the Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Factory pattern 
</h2>
<p>
    The Factory pattern is another creational pattern that is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of thing that will be created. In TypeScript, the Factory pattern is used to create objects without limiting their precise class. This pattern is proper when you need to create similar but not identical things, for example, when working with different buttons or forms.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Decorator pattern 
</h2>
<p>
    The Decorator pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to add functionality dynamically to an object without changing its class. In TypeScript, the Decorator pattern is used to add functionality to an object dynamically without changing its class. This pattern is proper when you want to add new functionality to an object without modifying its existing functionality, for example, when adding logging or caching to a function.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Observer pattern 
</h2>
<p>
    The Observer pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one thing changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. In TypeScript, the Observer pattern is used to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful when you need to keep multiple things in sync with each other, for example, when working with event listeners.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Strategy pattern 
</h2>
<p>
    The Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. In TypeScript, the Strategy pattern is used to describe a family of algorithms, encapsulate each, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is proper when you need to switch between different algorithms at runtime, for example, when working with varying sorting algorithms.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Adapter pattern 
</h2>
<p>
    The Adapter pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to adapt an existing class to work with another interface. This pattern is useful when you need to work with an existing class that does not implement an interface that you need, for example, when working with legacy code. In TypeScript, the Adapter pattern is used to adjust an existing class to work with another interface.
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    Dependency Injection pattern 
</h2>
<p>
    The Dependency Injection pattern is a design pattern that allows you to provide dependencies to an object at runtime rather than at compile time. In TypeScript, the Dependency Injection pattern provides dependencies to an object at runtime rather than compile time. This pattern is proper when you create highly decoupled objects, for example, when working with an extensive application with many modules.
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    Software design patterns are an essential part of the TypeScript developer's toolkit. They provide a set of proven solutions to common programming problems, making writing maintainable, reusable, and extensible code easier.
