					<div class="review-text">
						<p class="wow fadeInUp">Ty has been a technical subject matter expert for RESTful API design on my team since 2010. Ty authored the bulk of AT&T’s Guidelines for RESTful API
							Design. This document is an extremely useful compendium of best practices that we have used to drive consistency across APIs. The AT&T model has been to allow multiple
							diverse teams to create APIs that provide access to their technical services. In this model, it is critical that there be some standards that enable these teams to create
							APIs that can be easily consumed. This common approach allows developers consuming these APIs to understand and use these diverse services quickly and easily. In addition
							to authoring these standards for AT&T, Ty also sits as a member of the governing body that evaluated all APIs externally exposed by the company. Ty’s role on the
							“Northbound API Governance Board” has been to determine whether these emerging APIs adhere to RESTful guidelines and are appropriately useable for the developer community.
							Finally, in addition to authoring the standards and governing on their adherence, Ty plays an important consultative role with teams creating APIs. During the API design
							phase, countless teams have reached out for Ty’s guidance and he has helped them with a more effective RESTful design from the outset. This step has saved a tremendous
							amount of time by advising teams on how to pass the governance review ahead of time. Ty is a skilled API standards resource. However, I want to be sure to point out that Ty
							also has critical soft skills that make him a valuable member of the team. Ty has a very engaging personality and is a much more effective verbal communicator than most
							technical resources. I could see Ty doing an outstanding job as an API Evangelist or within Technical Sales. In summary, Ty has solid technical skills and outstanding
							people skills. I would strongly urge you to consider his candidacy for a wide range of positions. </p>

						<p class="wow fadeInUp"> Ty sits as a member of the North Bound API Governance team representing the Developer Advocacy group to ensure that APIs that are to be published by
							AT&T adhere to RESTful best practices, as defined by the industry as well as defined internally by AT&T. I would say he would have seen hundreds of RESTful API designs and
							implementations (in various flavors) for approval till now. Also, not to forget that those are not any theories or hypothesis but real world implementations. </p>

					<div class="review-text">
						<p class="wow fadeInUp"> During my duration at T­Mobile, Ty was an excellent addition to the team. Prior to Ty’s arrival the team was struggling, especially between the UI and
							the API layers, often with each team saying the other team was not following the correct approach. Ty was a key resource in getting the team on track and successfully
							communicate between the canvas team, API, and UDP team to ensure each of the teams were following industry best practices as well as follow application architecture
							standards. Ty developed proper architecture deliverables and pushed to have them all reviwe by the team, such as security, caching strategy, implementation plan, technology
							plan, and capability roadmap. For example: Ty took the lead in partnering with the Azure team to ensure the application followed T­mobile’s Azure design principles. Ty also
							partnered witth the securitty organizaiton to ensure that proper application security processes, and most importantly Ty took the lead to partner with EDP Pipeline to
							develop T­Mobiles first pipeline utilizing Azure. Towards the end of my time at T­Mobile, there was confusion in what the client was looking for in a future state
							architecture. Ty had developed a future state that leveraged many of the existing components, it was unclear that the client was truly looking for a future state ignoring
							what was in place today. This was not identified until after our second review meeting, when I specifically asked the question to the stakeholder. This was particulary
							challenging situation, as each of the tracks (UDP, API, UI) had expressed need, that Ty was taking into account. In the end I would love the opportunity to work with Ty in
							the future and respect in knowledge as an architect, and most importantly, his ability to overcome difficult sitiations. </p>

						<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I would like to admire Ty Showers for his work as a member of Asset Management Project in T­Mobile in few words during my journey with him till date.
							Ty is always driven and motivated with his work. He is very clear about what he owns within the department. Ty is a great asset to the team. He is very professional and
							focused in his work. Despite the difficult deadlines he maintains a positive attitude. He always responds to problems without getting angry or frustrated. His most
							outstanding “value” from what I have seen is his attitude towards continuous improvement. Always greeting with a smile is his forte which makes other co­workers like myself
							and others work energetically and focus on what is being done what needs to be done. The way of understanding his Architectural works like design flow, technical flow
							Department/Team wise is always crisp and clear when Ty puts them into words and pictorial representations apart from his other excellent works. Any Project is likely to be
							shallow and hollow without a valuable asset like Ty. </p>

						<h6>Sommer Anderson - t-Mobile</h6>

					<div class="review-text">
						<p class="wow fadeInUp"> I just wanted to commend Ty Showers on his excellent work as an architect for the T-Mobile Canvas project. He is extremely knowledgeable about best
							practices and ideal state architecture for API applications. He addresses customer concerns with industry experts and software vendors (such as Azure) to ensure his
							proposed solutions are feasible and meet customer requirements. He clarifies requirements that are vague or do not align with industry best practice to advise the customer
							of a better solution and to ensure the customer understands potential pitfalls. He was a pleasure to work with and found many details we had not considered that were
							crucial to our future state plans. He followed all T-Mobile standards and formats to provide detailed explanations of his proposed implementation, which, upon review with
							Azure, was the exact solution they would have created for us. Ty’s wealth of knowledge and dedication to providing sound, scalable architecture would best be leveraged
							within an organization where management does not think of themselves as architects. </p>
