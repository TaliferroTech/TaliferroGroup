<h2>
    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    We've all heard the old saying, "We don't know what we don't know." That's as true in business as it is in life. Organizations often miss opportunities for growth because they need to be fully aware of their finances. A recent survey by Gartner found that many businesses still view IT expenses as just another cost of doing business -- not an investment that can lead to increased revenue generation and performance. But the reality is this: Companies that see software and services as vehicles for growth are three times more likely than others to be high performers on vital financial measures such as operating margin and return on equity (ROE).
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    The Investment
</h2>
<p>
    Many organizations consider revenue generation an expense rather than a return on investment.
</p>
<p>
    Revenue generation isn't just an expense. It's a return on investment (ROI).
</p>
<p>
    Many organizations think of revenue as "another cost" or an "expense," not as a return on investment. Instead, they should consider those costs as investments that will lead to more substantial revenue growth in the future.
</p>
<p>
    This mindset is common in business and can help the company operate with a bottom-line mentality.
</p>
<p>
    An excellent way to think about expenses is that they're investments. This can be an efficient mindset for your business and help the company operate with a bottom-line mentality. The attitude that costs are bad and revenues are good is typical in the industry, and it's something that you should avoid running away from or feeling like you shouldn't use. This type of mindset is how many successful companies operate every day!
</p>
<p>
    If you don't consider your software investment as an expense, then what should it be? A revenue source!
</p>
<p>
    But when it comes to investing in software and technology, the right approach is to see those costs as investments that will lead to more robust revenue growth.
</p>
<p>
    But when it comes to investing in software and technology, the right approach is to see those costs as investments that will lead to more robust revenue growth. Here's an example: You'll invest $100,000 on a new ERP system for your business. The system will help your team collaborate more efficiently and allow you to get products out faster and better serve customers by meeting their needs faster than ever before. All this translates into more revenue for your company over time because you'll be able to make decisions and get products out there much more quickly.
</p>
<p>
    So how can you view software purchases as investments instead of expenses? First, look at the return on investment (ROI) of each piece of software or service that might positively impact revenue or productivity at your company. Do some research on competitors with similar tools in place, but wait to buy; instead, ask yourself whether or not their investment has paid off for them based on their financials (if available).
</p>
<p>
    A recent survey of more than 1,000 companies by Gartner shows that the highest-performing companies view their IT investments as vehicles for growth. Companies with a total view of their IT spending are three times as likely to be high performers. This is good news for small businesses with limited technology budgets, and they need to ensure that every dollar spent is well spent to stay competitive.
</p>
<p>
    These companies were nearly three times as likely to be high performers compared with organizations where leaders viewed IT as just another expense.
</p>
<p>
    In essence, the study found that if you view your IT budget as an investment in your business and not an expense, you're more likely to get that return on your money. In other words, investing in quality software and services will help grow your business.
</p>
<p>
    It's also important to note that when high performers were asked how they viewed their company's performance over the past year, they were more positive than those who were considered average or low performers:
</p>
<p>
    40% of high performers said their company had been "excellent" or "terrific." This number fell to 26% among average performers; it dropped further still among lagging companies at 19%.
</p>
<p>
    57% of high performers said their firm had seen growth during this period—more than double those mid-level companies (28%) and nearly triple those behind the curve (21%).
</p>
<h2 class="text-capitalize">
    antiquated view of IT costs

</h2>
<p>
    The problem is that many organizations have yet to move away from this antiquated view of IT costs. The study found that only 38% of businesses take a total picture of their IT spending, and only 3% track the performance of each investment in software and services they make. In other words, while most businesses view expenses as an unavoidable cost of doing business, they often fail to consider that investing in particular technologies could help them become more efficient and productive at scale, increasing their long-term profitability.
</p>
<p>
    The study found that only 38 percent of businesses take a total view of their IT spending, meaning they consider investments in software and services as ways to improve the overall ability of a company to generate new revenue or enhance its existing products and services.

</p>
<p>
    However, the study found that these companies are more likely to meet or exceed financial expectations than their counterparts that don't have such integrated approaches. They're also more likely to have larger budgets for IT spending.
</p>
<p>
    It's a troubling disconnect because those organizations that embrace digital transformation typically have larger budgets for IT spending -- and they're more likely to meet or exceed financial expectations than their counterparts that don't have such integrated approaches.
</p>
<p>
    Digital transformation is a big topic for businesses, but many things need to be clarified about what it means. Digital transformation is about leveraging technology to make your business more efficient and effective. It's about improving customer service by having better tools to serve customers in-store or online. It's about improving employee productivity by giving them the right tools to do their jobs better and faster. And finally, digital transformation can also be used to enhance revenue generation by helping businesses sell products or services more effectively through an integrated approach with their marketing efforts that drives traffic and conversions on their website or mobile app.
</p>
<p>
    Although only some businesses are willing (or able) to completely overhaul their accounting practices to accommodate new approaches, leaders can undoubtedly keep them in mind when evaluating how best to spend their budgets.

    Although few businesses are willing (or able) to completely overhaul their accounting practices to accommodate new approaches, leaders can undoubtedly keep them in mind when evaluating how best to spend their budgets. Software and services aren't just about efficiency or productivity. They're about revenue generation—and if you don't have an eye on the ROI from your IT investments, you may be missing out on opportunities for growth that you could have otherwise been taking advantage of. When considering your company's spending as a whole, make sure you're considering the total view of IT spending: what does it take for us to generate revenue? What does it take for us to serve our clients well? And how can we do those things better through technology?
</p>
<h2>
    Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    This may sound like a lot of work, and it is. But the payoff is worth it. The key is to look at your IT investments as an investment in revenue generation and not just another expense. Many businesses are already doing this, but many others still need it. If you want to be among those that do, make sure your accounting department understands this new approach so they can help you get there faster.
