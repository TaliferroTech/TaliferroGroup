                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> More businesses increasingly use <a routerLink="/e-commerce-architecture">e-commerce</a> platforms to sell their products and services online. There are two main options when choosing an e-commerce platform:
                                building your platform from scratch or using a pre-built e-commerce platform. This blog post will explore the advantages and disadvantages of using a pre-built
                                <a routerLink="/e-commerce-architecture">e-commerce</a> platform. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Advantages of pre-built e-commerce platforms </h2>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Easy setup </h4>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms come with a pre-designed template and an easy-to-use interface, making it easy for businesses to set up their online store quickly. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Affordable </h4>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms are usually more affordable than building a custom platform from scratch. They offer a range of pricing plans to suit different business
                                needs and budgets. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Technical support </h4>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms offer technical support, ensuring that businesses can get help with any technical issues or glitches that may arise. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Security </h4>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms are designed with security in mind. They offer a range of security features such as SSL encryption, firewalls, and regular updates to
                                protect customers' data and prevent fraud. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Integrations </h4>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms offer a range of integrations with third-party tools and services, such as payment gateways, shipping providers, and marketing tools,
                                making it easy for businesses to expand their online store's functionality. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Disadvantages of pre-built e-commerce platforms </h2>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Limited customizability </h4>
                            <p> While pre-built e-commerce platforms offer a range of templates, themes, and customization options, businesses need more regarding how much they can customize their
                                online store. This may be a disadvantage for companies that want a unique design or specific features that are not available. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Monthly fees </h4>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms usually charge a monthly fee, which can add up over time, especially for businesses with a large inventory or high sales volume. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Transaction fees </h4>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms may charge a transaction fee on every sale made through their platform. This can add up, especially for businesses with a high sales
                                volume. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Limited control </h4>
                            <p> The provider owns pre-built e-commerce platforms, meaning businesses have limited control over their online store's functionality and data. This can disadvantage
                                businesses that want complete control over their online store. </p>
                            <h4 class="text-capitalize"> Platform lock-in </h4>
                            <p> Once a business chooses a pre-built e-commerce platform, it may be challenging to switch to another venue. This can disadvantage businesses that want flexibility and
                                freedom to choose the best platform for their needs. </p>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> Pre-built e-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce offer businesses a range of advantages and disadvantages. While they provide an easy and affordable way to
                                set up an online store, they also have limitations regarding customizability, monthly fees, transaction fees, and control. Businesses should carefully consider their
                                needs and budget before choosing a pre-built e-commerce platform and weigh the advantages and disadvantages against their business goals. </p>
