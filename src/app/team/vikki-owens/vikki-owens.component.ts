My strengths are grounded in think-action, perfected by many years of experience in the event planning industry, which was the perfect training environment for progressing to project management, team building, and organizational development.</p>" + 

  "<p class=\"wow fadeInUp\">Accurately assessing the big picture while analyzing details will benefit any project I am involved in because I will methodically evaluate, strategize, plan, coordinate, and execute to the best of my ability â€” and with complete transparency.</p>" +
  
  "<p class=\"wow fadeInUp\">My experience as a business builder in multiple industries, B2B and B2C, plus continuous upskilling, has given me practical knowledge of all aspects of business creation. I have served in many different roles in the pursuit of establishing, scaling, and managing a successful enterprise. A Scrum Alliance Certified Product Owner and Scrum Master gives me great insight into how to delight software development customers, users, and stakeholders in other lines of business.</p>" +
  
  "<p class=\"wow fadeInUp\">Moreover, years of nonprofit experience add tools to my toolbox that I use to enhance how I can help organizations achieve goals. Serving as a media vice president, committee chair of logistics, and volunteer engagement for different nonprofit sectors, I incorporate best practices that best fit the situation. Others cannot offer what I do because my journey and perspective are as unique as my fingerprint.</p>"
