                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> As a language model, I cannot have opinions. Still, I can provide some arguments and benefits of Angular over React that help you understand why some developers prefer
                                Angular. </p>
                            <p> Angular and React are popular JavaScript frameworks that developers worldwide have widely used. Both frameworks have advantages and disadvantages, but I will focus on
                                why some developers might prefer Angular over React in this blog post. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Angular </h2>
                            <p> Angular is built around the idea of creating reusable components that are made up of a template (HTML) and a controller (JavaScript). One of the main reasons why some
                                developers love Angular is the separation of HTML and JavaScript. This separation makes it easier for developers to write and maintain their code, as they can focus on
                                the application's logic without worrying about the presentation layer. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Directives </h2>
                            <p> Another advantage of Angular is the use of directives. Directives extend the functionality of HTML, allowing developers to create custom HTML elements and attributes
                                that can be used throughout the application. This makes creating complex user interfaces and custom components easy without writing much JavaScript code. </p>
                            <p> Angular also offers tight integration with the Firestore database, a cloud-based NoSQL database that can store and sync data in real time. This integration makes it
                                easy for developers to build real-time applications that can scale to meet the needs of their users. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Cloud Functions </h2>
                            <p> Furthermore, Angular has built-in integration with cloud functions, allowing developers to run <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3a64388bbe76b2957e6be89844c315e6&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=11036071">server</a>-side code in response to events their application triggers. This
                                integration makes it easy to create serverless applications that can scale to meet the needs of their users without having to worry about managing servers or
                                infrastructure. </p>
                            <p> Finally, after the initial learning curve, many developers find it relatively easy to create complex applications with Angular. The framework has many built-in features
                                and tools that can be used to create powerful applications with minimal effort. This makes it easier for developers to focus on their application's logic without
                                worrying about the underlying infrastructure. </p>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> While both Angular and React are remarkable frameworks for building web applications, some developers might prefer Angular because it separates HTML and JavaScript,
                                uses directives, tight integration with the Firestore database and cloud functions, and ease of use after the initial learning curve. Ultimately, the choice between
                                Angular and React will depend on your application's specific needs and your development team's preferences. </p>
