                            <h2> Introduction </h2>
                            <p> When talking about cloud-based applications, we usually talk about microservice architecture. Microservices are easier to deploy and manage than monolithic
                                applications. However, they still follow the same principles that monolithic apps have used for a long time: abstraction, encapsulation, and separation of concerns.
                                Let's break down what each of these means in the context of layered application architecture in the cloud. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> What is a layer? </h2>
                            <p> A layer is a set of functions and services that perform a specific task. For example, an application may have a user interface layer that handles the presentation of
                                the information. The data layer is responsible for processing requests, while the business logic layer decides what to do with those requests and how to respond to
                                them. This type of architecture enables you to add new functionality without affecting existing components in other layers, which makes it easier for you to make
                                changes in your codebase. </p>
                            <p> When developing software applications, developers need to think about how their code will be organized into logical groups called "layers." Each layer adds value to the
                                overall application by working together with other layers through well-defined interfaces defined by each component (for example, API endpoints). Layers can be stacked
                                on top of one another to build up an entire application. This process is known as the modular design, where individual modules interact through well-defined contracts
                                between them so they're easily replaceable when needed while keeping all their dependencies intact. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> The basics of a layered architecture </h2>
                            <p> A layered architecture breaks down an application into separate components, each with a specific responsibility. This can be done in many ways, from simple to very
                                complex. The most straightforward approach is to break the application up into layers based on their responsibilities and interactions, for example: </p>
                            <p> Presentation layer - this layer handles the user interface and translates user input into commands for other layers via an API </p>
                            <p> Business logic layer - this layer contains business rules and processes that are used by one or more applications </p>
                            <p> Data access/data management layer - this layer manages access to data and provides methods for performing database queries or other tasks related to managing data </p>
                            <p> The key thing about layering is that each component is independent of all others below it in the stack, which means that changes made at one level won't affect any
                                lower levels (likewise, changes at lower levels won't affect higher ones). This makes it easier to upgrade individual parts of your system without having to rebuild
                                everything else at once. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Monolith or microservice? </h2>
                            <p> So, where do you start? Monoliths or microservices? The answer is simple: it depends on your context. While the monolith is more traditional architecture and has been
                                used for decades in the enterprise, the microservice approach makes sense when you build software with a modern mindset and employ DevOps practices. </p>
                            <p> If you have an existing code base that cannot be broken apart easily into smaller components and then deployed independently as microservices, then it might make sense
                                to keep using a monolithic architecture for now—and break up your application into individual microservices in due course as part of an ongoing effort to shift from
                                waterfall development towards continuous delivery (CD). </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Layers in the cloud </h2>
                            <p> The cloud is a natural fit for layered architecture. The cloud provides the infrastructure you can layer your applications and services, thus allowing you to scale up
                                and down as needed. If one part of your application starts seeing more traffic than expected, you can spin up new servers and services until the demand returns to
                                normal. To be clear: I'm not advocating that all applications should be built using this type of layered architecture, but it does work well in some cases. For example,
                                if you want to develop an API-first API service that offers different functionality based on whether users are logged in or not (e.g., providing access to their profile
                                information versus restricting access), then having each user session run at its layer makes sense. Each layer has its own set of resources and handles responses
                                differently depending on whether someone is authenticated. </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Abstracting Application Cloud Architecture </h2>
                            <p> The most common form of layered architecture is the three-tier model. It consists of a presentation, service, data layer, and a separate user interface (UI) or
                                application programming interface (API). </p>
                            <p> The UI enables users to interact with the software. The API provides programmatic access to the application's functions over an Internet connection. The service layer
                                manages <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=b0cf50c24dc4b6f4888b124d2bd6f018&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=1292110011">data storage</a> and retrieval from databases in different parts of an application's lifecycle. </p>
                            <p> In a cloud-based environment, developers can use API calls to integrate these services into their applications—reducing complexity since they don't need to manage all
                                deployment aspects themselves. This leads us back around again: What exactly does cloud mean? </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> Layered applications in the cloud </h2>
                            <p> In Cloud Computing, a layered architecture is an excellent way to design applications. The same principles can be applied to cloud-based applications as they are used
                                in monolithic applications, and this is what we will discuss in the following sections. </p>
                            <p> Cloud Computing allows you to use different types of resources (e.g., CPUs, memory and storage) depending on your needs and at different times, which means that there
                                may not always be enough resources available for your application in its entirety at any given time. This makes it necessary to split an application into components
                                that use resources from one or more services independently or sequentially. So let's take a look at how this works for both types of architectures: </p>
                            <h2 class="text-capitalize"> The problem with SOA and microservices </h2>
                            <p> You may have heard that SOA and microservices are the same things. They're not. </p>
                            <p> So what is SOA? It's an architectural pattern that has been around since the late 90s, but it's still relevant today because it allows you to decouple your business
                                logic from its underlying infrastructure. A service-oriented architecture aims to create loose coupling between services so they can be easily integrated into different
                                parts of your enterprise architecture (EA). It's important to note that SOA doesn't refer only to technology; it's more about how you structure your application. </p>
                            <p> Microservices are a set of technologies used for building SOAs—they're not one in the same thing! </p>
                            <p> Cloud-based applications can follow the same principles that monolithic applications have used for a long time — separation of concerns, abstraction, and modularity.
                                However, they need to be implemented in a slightly different way. </p>
                            <p> The main goal is to create self-contained components with clear responsibilities and interfaces. They should be easily reusable because you need to know what problems
                                you will run into when your application grows. </p>
                            <p> Microservice architecture, when done correctly, can make the difference between a practical solution and an ineffective one. </p>
                            <p> Let's break down what microservice architecture is and how it can be used to build more effective solutions. </p>
                            <p> Microservices are a way of building applications that can scale out. Instead of having a single monolithic application, you have many small ones that perform specific
                                functions for your system. These more minor services can split themselves up even further into subcomponents if needed, depending on how granular the requirements of
                                each service are. Each microservice should be able to run independently from other parts of the application or system; this makes it much easier to scale out (or in) by
                                adding or removing instances when needed — no longer do you need to worry about adding an entirely new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?_encoding=UTF8&tag=taliferro2023-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3a64388bbe76b2957e6be89844c315e6&camp=1789&creative=9325&node=11036071">server</a> to handle some extra load! You can also monitor these
                                smaller components individually for performance issues, so there aren't bottlenecks or hiccups anywhere else in the system. </p>
                            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                            <p> In this post, I've given you a high-level overview of layered applications. I want to convince you that this approach is not just for legacy codebases but can also be
                                applied to modern cloud-based applications. As you design your next application or rewrite an old one, think about how splitting it into layers could improve its
                                performance, scalability, and security. </p>
